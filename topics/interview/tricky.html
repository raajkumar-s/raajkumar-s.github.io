                <h3>1. What is the value of <code>foo.x</code>?</h3>
                <h5>Tags: javascript, assignment-operator, object-reference</h5>
                <strong><code>
                   var foo = {n: 1};<br/>
                   var bar = foo;<br/>
                   foo.x = foo = {n: 2};<br/>
                </code></strong>
                <p>Ans: <code>undefined</code></p>
                <p>Surprised? Expected <code>{n:2}</code>? Let's see why it's not.</p>

                <p>Before getting in to the details, you should know that eventhough assignment operator (=) has right-to-left associativity, according to spec <b>expression</b> on the right side is evaluated first. This is get to the reference of the memory to which the evaluated value will be assigned</p>
                <p>Let's break the code</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>var foo = {n: 1};</code>
                            <p>
                                At this stage a new object is created in memory and a reference is assigned to <code>foo</code>
                            </p>
                            <div class="fig fig1"></div>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>var bar = foo;</code>
                            <p>
                                Now a new variable named <code>bar</code> is created and assigned with same reference as <code>foo</code>
                            </p>
                            <div class="fig fig2"></div>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>foo.x = foo = {n: 2};</code>
                            <p>
                                Now comes the tricky part. Since the assignment operator has right-to-left (RTL) associativity, the above line of code will be equal to <code>foo.x = (foo = {n: 2});</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One can naturally expect that <code>(foo = {n: 2})</code> will return <code>{n: 2}</code> which should then be assigned to <code>foo</code>. That's true incase of primitives, it's not same for objects. Here references plays role rather than values.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Evaluate the left-hand expression foo.x to get a reference, which is where the value of the right-hand expression will be assigned to.</p>
                                            <div class="fig fig3"></div>
                                        </div>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Evaluate the right-hand expression, to to get the value that will be assigned. The right-hand side is another assignment expression, so it gets evaluated the same way:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Evaluate foo to determine where to assign to.</li>
                                                <li>Evaluate the expression {n:2}, which creates an object, to determine the value to assign.</li>
                                                <li>Assign {n:2} to foo, and return {n:2}.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <div class="fig fig4"></div>
                                            <small>Note: The <code>foo</code> which is green color is temporary.</small>
                                        </div>


                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>
                                                Assign the value that the expression on the right-side evaluated to ({n:2}), to the reference that foo.x resolved to in step 1 (before foo was assigned a new value). Which is also the same as bar.x, because of the assignment bar = foo on the line before.
                                            </p>
                                            <div class="fig fig5"></div>
                                        </div>

                                    </li>
                                    <p>
                                        When this is done, the original object, that bar is still a reference to, will have an x property that references the second object created. foo is also a reference to that second object, so foo === bar.x.
                                        <div class="fig fig6"></div>
                                    </p>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since <code>foo</code> is new object which is referring to <code>{n : 2};</code> there no such property called <code>x</code> in <code>foo</code> object now. So <code><strong>foo.x</strong></code> will be <code><strong>undefined</strong></code>.
                    </p>

                <h3>2. Find the <code>bleak</code>number.</h3>
                <h5>Tags: javascript, bitwise-operator</h5>
                <p>
                    In Mathematics each number has one special number, which it supports, chosen as follows.</br>
                    * It counts the number of ones in its own binary representation, and adds this count to itself to obtain the value of the number it supports.</br>
                    * That is, if j(m) means the number of ones in the binary representation of m, then m supports m+j(m).</br>
                    * For example, the number eight (1000 in binary) supports nine, whereas nine supports eleven. However, in this way not all the numbers get supported; some are left without support, and we call these numbers bleak. For example since one supports two, two supports three and three supports five, there is no number less than four, which would support four, so four is bleak. Your task is for a given number recognize if it is bleak or supported by some number.
