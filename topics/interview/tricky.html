                <h3>What is the value of <code>foo.x</code>?</h3>
                <strong><code>
                   var foo = {n: 1};<br/>
                   var bar = foo;<br/>
                   foo.x = foo = {n: 2};<br/>
                </code></strong>
                <p>Ans: <code>undefined</code></p>
                <p>Surprised? Expected <code>{n:2}</code>? Let's see why it's not.</p>

                <p>Before getting in to the details, you should know that eventhough assignment operator (=) has right-to-left associativity, according to spec <b>expression</b> on the right side is evaluated first. This is get to the reference of the memory to which the evaluated value will be assigned</p>
                <p>Let's break the code</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>var foo = {n: 1};</code>
                            <p>
                                At this stage a new object is created in memory and a reference is assigned to <code>foo</code>
                            </p>
                            <div class="fig fig1"></div>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>var bar = foo;</code>
                            <p>
                                Now a new variable named <code>bar</code> is created and assigned with same reference as <code>foo</code>
                            </p>
                            <div class="fig fig2"></div>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <code>foo.x = foo = {n: 2};</code>
                            <p>
                                Now comes the tricky part. Since the assignment operator has right-to-left (RTL) associativity, the above line of code will be equal to <code>foo.x = (foo = {n: 2});</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One can naturally expect that <code>(foo = {n: 2})</code> will return <code>{n: 2}</code> which should then be assigned to <code>foo</code>. That's true incase of primitives, it's not same for objects. Here references plays role rather than values.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Evaluate the left-hand expression foo.x to get a reference, which is where the value of the right-hand expression will be assigned to.</p>
                                            <div class="fig fig3"></div>
                                        </div>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Evaluate the right-hand expression, to to get the value that will be assigned. The right-hand side is another assignment expression, so it gets evaluated the same way:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Evaluate foo to determine where to assign to.</li>
                                                <li>Evaluate the expression {n:2}, which creates an object, to determine the value to assign.</li>
                                                <li>Assign {n:2} to foo, and return {n:2}.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <div class="fig fig4"></div>
                                            <small>Note: The <code>foo</code> which is green color is temporary.</small>
                                        </div>


                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>
                                                Assign the value that the expression on the right-side evaluated to ({n:2}), to the reference that foo.x resolved to in step 1 (before foo was assigned a new value). Which is also the same as bar.x, because of the assignment bar = foo on the line before.
                                            </p>
                                            <div class="fig fig5"></div>
                                        </div>

                                    </li>
                                    <p>
                                        When this is done, the original object, that bar is still a reference to, will have an x property that references the second object created. foo is also a reference to that second object, so foo === bar.x.
                                        <div class="fig fig6"></div>
                                    </p>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since <code>foo</code> is new object which is referring to <code>{n : 2};</code> there no such property called <code>x</code> in <code>foo</code> object now. <code><strong>foo.x</strong></code> will be <code><strong>undefined</strong></code>.
                    </p>
